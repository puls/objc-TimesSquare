/** The `TSQCalendarMonthHeaderCell` class displays the month name and day names at the top of a month's worth of weeks.
 
 By default, it lays out the day names in the bottom 20 points, the month name in the remainder of its height, and has a height of 65 points. You'll want to subclass it to change any of those things.
