/** The `TSQCalendarRowCell` class is a cell that represents one week in the calendar.
 
 Each of the seven columns can represent a day that's in this month, a day that's not in this month, a selected day, today, or an unselected day. The cell uses several images placed strategically to achieve the effect.

 This image should be as wide as the entire view and include the grid lines between the columns. It will probably also include the grid line at the top of the row, but not the one at the bottom.
 
 You might, however, return a different image that includes both the grid line at the top and the one at the bottom if the `bottomRow` property is set to `YES`. You might even adjust the `cellHeight`.
